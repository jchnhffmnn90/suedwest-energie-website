# Penetration Testing for Südwest-Energie Website

This directory contains a comprehensive penetration testing script for the Südwest-Energie website. The script tests various security aspects of the website to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Pentest Script Features

The pentest script (`pentest_suedwestenergie.py`) includes tests for:

- **Security Headers Analysis**: Checks for proper security headers implementation
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Tests for potential XSS vulnerabilities in form inputs
- **SQL Injection**: Tests for SQL injection vulnerabilities in form inputs
- **Form Validation Bypass**: Tests if form validation can be bypassed
- **CSRF Protection**: Checks for proper CSRF token implementation
- **Directory Enumeration**: Tests for exposed sensitive directories/files
- **Information Disclosure**: Looks for information that might be disclosed in error messages
- **Ninox API Integration**: Tests for secure integration with Ninox API

## Running the Pentest

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

### Basic Usage
```bash
python pentest_suedwestenergie.py --url http://localhost:3000
```

### Options
- `--url`: Target website URL (default: http://localhost:3000)
- `--timeout`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
- `--output`: Output file for results (default: pentest_results.json)

### Examples
```bash
# Test default local installation
python pentest_suedwestenergie.py

# Test a specific URL
python pentest_suedwestenergie.py --url https://www.suedwest-energie.de

# Set custom timeout and output file
python pentest_suedwestenergie.py --url http://localhost:3000 --timeout 15 --output my_pentest_results.json
```

## Understanding Results

The pentest script categorizes vulnerabilities by severity:
- **Critical**: High-risk vulnerabilities that could lead to data compromise
- **High**: Significant vulnerabilities that could affect security
- **Medium**: Moderate vulnerabilities that should be addressed
- **Low**: Minor issues that are generally less concerning

## Security Recommendations Based on Findings

### Missing Security Headers
If security headers are missing, implement them in the application or web server configuration:
- `X-Frame-Options` to prevent clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection` for basic XSS protection
- `X-Content-Type-Options` to prevent MIME-type confusion
- `Content-Security-Policy` to mitigate XSS attacks
- `Strict-Transport-Security` for HTTPS enforcement
- `Referrer-Policy` to control referrer information

### Form Input Validation
Ensure all form inputs are properly validated both client and server-side:
- Validate email formats
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper length limits
- Use proper encoding to prevent XSS

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Use parameterized queries
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement proper access controls
- Use least-privilege database accounts

### CSRF Protection
- Implement proper CSRF tokens
- Validate tokens on form submission
- Use stateless solutions where appropriate

## Legal Notice

⚠️ **Important**: Only run this pentest script against systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized penetration testing is illegal and unethical. Always obtain proper authorization before testing any system.

## Development

The pentest script is intended for security testing in development and staging environments. Ensure that you have proper authorization before running these tests on any system.
